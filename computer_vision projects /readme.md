# 🎭 Face Detection System

A real-time face detection application built with Python and OpenCV, using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect and highlight faces via webcam feed.

---

## 📸 Demo

> The system draws bounding boxes around detected faces in real time and displays a live face count on screen.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face detection via webcam
- Haar Cascade classifier for fast and reliable detection
- Live face count overlay on video feed
- Save captured frames as images with a single keypress
- Lightweight and easy to run locally

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Library:** [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`cv2`)
- **Model:** Haar Cascade — `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` (bundled with OpenCV)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
cd face-detection
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Save the current frame as `captured_face.jpg` |
| `q` | Quit the application |

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can tweak the detection parameters in the script to adjust sensitivity:

```python
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(
    gray,
    scaleFactor=1.3,   # How much the image is scaled down at each step
    minNeighbors=5,    # Higher = fewer false positives
)
```

If your webcam isn't detected, change the camera index:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Try 0, 1, or 2 depending on your system
```

> **macOS users:** The script uses `cv2.CAP_AVFOUNDATION` as the backend, which is the recommended capture API for macOS.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loads OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade frontal face model
2. Captures live video from the webcam frame by frame
3. Converts each frame to grayscale (required for Haar detection)
4. Runs `detectMultiScale` to find face regions
5. Draws green rectangles around detected faces and shows the count
6. Displays the annotated frame in a window in real time
